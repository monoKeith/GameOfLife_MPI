Each 'test x output.txt' is the state of the board
after running 'test x input.txt' for 10 generations.

All examples were generated by playing around with
http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/. Screenshots of the
input and output test patterns of each test are also
provided. The input/output files were created by
duplicating the patterns.

I recommend making sure the supplied examples 
work as well as building your own test cases, as your 
assignment will be tested on examples not supplied here. 
Ensure that your code always returns consistent solutions 
regardless of what value you use for p. 

Also please ensure that your code can load the input files 
in the exact format given in the example files here. This is 
the format of the files that will be used to mark your 
assignment.
